# ðŸ‘Ÿ pushstart.clj

Sometimes all you need to do is get a little experiment running in a REPL with some utilities.

`pushstart` generates a small project starter containing:

- `deps.edn`
- `script.clj`â€”Utilities already imported
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore` â€”tailored to Clojure.

## Utilities

`pushstart.clj` creates a project with most of the utilities you'll need for small tasks.
All of the following utilities are already imported and aliased.

- `clojure.set`
- `clojure.string`
- [`clojure.data.json`](https://github.com/clojure/data.json)
- [`clojure.data.csv`](https://github.com/clojure/data.csv)
- [`math.combinatorics`](https://github.com/clojure/math.combinatorics)
- [`camel-snake-kebab`](https://github.com/clj-commons/camel-snake-kebab)
- [`clojure.java-time`](https://github.com/dm3/clojure.java-time)
- [`clj-http`](https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http)
- [`Malli`](https://github.com/metosin/malli)
- [`Hashp`](https://github.com/weavejester/hashp)
